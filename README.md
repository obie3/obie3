# Hi, I’m Edward 👋

I’m a senior mobile engineer focused on building and maintaining production mobile apps with React Native and TypeScript.

Over the past 6+ years, I’ve worked on consumer fintech products and a national digital identity platform used by over one million people. My work has involved owning app stability, security-sensitive flows, release processes, and long-term maintenance in regulated environments.

I’m comfortable working with distributed teams, async workflows, and taking clear ownership of features from design through production.

### Tech I work with
- React Native, TypeScript
- Mobile app architecture and state management
- Secure storage, biometric authentication
- CI/CD, OTA updates, app store releases

- **Wemunize (USAID)** – Immunization reminder app used by 25k+ families
